# Wizaplace front-office demo

The StarterKit is a template web application for creating a front-office for Wizaplace.

It is based on PHP 7.1, Symfony 3 and [our PHP SDK](https://github.com/wizaplace/wizaplace-php-sdk). The front-office connects to Wizaplace through the API ([API documentation](https://sandbox.wizaplace.com/api/v1/doc/)).

## Architecture

The StarterKit project is meant to be cloned (forked on GitHub for example) for each new front-office project. The cloned version can then be customized to fit the target design.

## Features

The StarterKit is a project in development. While all features are implemented in the PHP SDK, some pages and features may be missing in the StarterKit. If you need them, you will need to create or modify the Symfony routes/controlers/views to add them.

This is the list of pages and features we will be adding soon in the StarterKit:

- [ ] Brand page ([SDK](https://github.com/wizaplace/wizaplace-php-sdk/blob/master/src/Catalog/CatalogService.php#L112) and [API](https://sandbox.wizaplace.com/api/v1/doc/#tag/Catalog%2Fpaths%2F~1catalog~1attributes~1variants~1%7BattributeVariantId%7D%2Fget))
- Product page:
    - [ ] Add the product to favorites ([SDK](https://github.com/wizaplace/wizaplace-php-sdk/blob/master/src/Favorite/FavoriteService.php#L62-L67) and [API](https://sandbox.wizaplace.com/api/v1/doc/#tag/Favorites%2Fpaths%2F~1user~1favorites~1declinations~1%7BdeclinationId%7D%2Fpost))
    - [ ] Send a message to the vendor ([SDK](https://github.com/wizaplace/wizaplace-php-sdk/blob/master/src/Discussion/DiscussionService.php#L16-L37) and [API](https://sandbox.wizaplace.com/api/v1/doc/#tag/Discussion%2Fpaths%2F~1discussions%2Fpost))
    - [ ] Report a product (in development, available in a few days)
- My Account:
    - [ ] List of favorite products ([SDK](https://github.com/wizaplace/wizaplace-php-sdk/blob/master/src/Favorite/FavoriteService.php#L22-L29) and [API](https://sandbox.wizaplace.com/api/v1/doc/#tag/Favorites%2Fpaths%2F~1user~1favorites~1declinations%2Fget))
    - [ ] List of discussions with vendors ([SDK](https://github.com/wizaplace/wizaplace-php-sdk/blob/master/src/Discussion/DiscussionService.php#L16-L37) and [API](https://sandbox.wizaplace.com/api/v1/doc/#tag/Discussion%2Fpaths%2F~1discussions%2Fget))

## Setup

### Using Vagrant

**This is the recommended solution.**

Requirements:

- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads),
- [Vagrant 1.9.5](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/1.9.5/),
- [Landrush](https://github.com/vagrant-landrush/landrush) and [Vagrant-cachier plugin](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-cachier) plugins: `vagrant plugin install landrush vagrant-cachier`,
- NFS on Linux: `sudo apt-get install nfs-common nfs-kernel-server`.

If you have not done this already, you need to create a SSH key and configure it into your GitHub account: https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/

Store your SSH key in the SSH agent:

- MacOS: `ssh-add -K`
- Linux: `ssh-add`

Clone the project and install it:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:wizaplace/starterkit.git
$ cd starterkit/
$ make dev-from-scratch
```

The website is now reachable at [http://demo.loc/](http://demo.loc/).

At any time you can rebuild everything by running `make dev-from-scratch` again.

#### Customization

You can customize your local Vagrant configuration by creating a file named `Vagrantfile.local`, for example:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure(VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION) do |config|
    config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|
        v.memory = 1536
        v.cpus = 2
        v.customize ['modifyvm', :id, '--cableconnected1', 'on']
    end

    config.vm.provision "file", source: "~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/honukai.zsh-theme", destination: "/home/vagrant/.oh-my-zsh/themes/honukai.zsh-theme"
    config.vm.provision "file", source: "~/vagrant-zshrc", destination: "/home/vagrant/.zshrc"
    config.vm.provision "shell", path: "~/vagrant-provision.sh"

    config.vm.network 'forwarded_port', guest: 3306, host: 3306
end
```

### Without Vagrant

This method can be used when Vagrant cannot be made to work.

Requirements:

- PHP 7.1
- Composer
- NPM
- Gulp

```
make install
# Run the built-in webserver
bin/console server:run
```

The application should be available at http://localhost:8000/

## Development

To compile assets, simply run `gulp`. Gulp will watch changes and recompile Javascript, CSS, etc. automatically.

Here are our integration guidelines: [wizaplace/integration-guidelines](https://github.com/wizaplace/integration-guidelines).
